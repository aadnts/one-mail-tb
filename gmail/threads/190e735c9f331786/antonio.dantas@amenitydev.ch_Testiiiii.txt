Subject: Rebuilding Derna: An Opportunity for Strabag's Expertise and
Global Impact

Dear Strabag Group,

MedCost SA, an international agency company with a proven track record
of success in complex reconstruction projects, is writing to you today
with an extraordinary opportunity to partner with us in rebuilding
Derna, a city devastated by the devastating floods of September 10,
2023.

The devastation caused by these floods is immense. Homes, businesses,
infrastructure, and agricultural land have been severely damaged,
leaving over 43,000 people displaced and countless others in need of
urgent assistance. The Libyan government, while committed to recovery
efforts, recognizes the immense scale of this undertaking and is
seeking international cooperation to ensure its success.

Strabag, with its unparalleled expertise in construction and
infrastructure development, is uniquely positioned to lead the
reconstruction of Derna. Your company's global presence, vast
resources, and commitment to sustainability align perfectly with the
goals of this project.

Our proposed partnership with Strabag would involve a comprehensive
approach to rebuilding Derna, incorporating the following key
elements:

1. Comprehensive Damage Assessment:

Prior to any reconstruction efforts, a thorough assessment of the
damage is essential. Strabag can either send its own personnel to
Libya to conduct this assessment or utilize the expertise of local
consultants. The goal is to gain a clear understanding of the extent
of the damage, including the structural integrity of buildings, the
impact on infrastructure and utilities, and the specific needs of the
affected communities.

2. Masterplan Development:

Based on the damage assessment, Strabag will develop a comprehensive
masterplan for Derna's reconstruction. This masterplan will prioritize
the following aspects:

	* Safety and Resilience: Incorporating flood-resistant design
elements into new buildings, upgrading existing drainage systems, and
constructing flood barriers to ensure Derna's resilience against
future floods.

	* Urban Planning and Livability: Enhancing the overall livability of
the city by pedestrianizing certain areas, creating more green spaces,
and improving public transportation.

	* Sustainability and Environmental Friendliness: Employing
sustainable materials, energy-efficient buildings, and water
conservation measures to align with Strabag's commitment to
sustainability.

	* Economic Opportunities and Local Business Promotion: Creating new
economic opportunities by supporting local businesses, encouraging
tourism, and attracting new investments.

	* Addressing Root Causes: Identifying and addressing the root causes
of the floods, such as poor infrastructure, inadequate drainage
systems, and climate change. This may involve long-term planning and
investment in disaster risk reduction measures.

3. Reconstruction Implementation:

Strabag will oversee the implementation of the masterplan, ensuring
that the reconstruction efforts are efficient, cost-effective, and
transparent. This will involve establishing a clear timeline, managing
resources effectively, and adhering to strict quality control
standards.

4. Community Engagement:

Strabag will prioritize community engagement throughout the
reconstruction process. This includes involving local residents in
decision-making processes, ensuring that their needs and priorities
are considered, and fostering a sense of ownership and pride in the
rebuilt city.

Options for Cooperation:

To maximize the potential for cooperation, we offer Strabag two
options:

	* Project Management: Strabag can lead the reconstruction project
from afar, managing the masterplan, overseeing implementation, and
ensuring adherence to quality standards. The actual construction work
can be carried out by another specialized company.

	* Full Reconstruction: Strabag can undertake the full reconstruction
project, managing all aspects from masterplan development to
construction and handover. This option allows Strabag to showcase its
expertise and make a lasting impact on Derna's revitalization.

We believe that Strabag's partnership with MedCost SA has the
potential to transform Derna into a resilient, sustainable, and
prosperous city. The opportunity to contribute to this significant
reconstruction effort is one that aligns perfectly with Strabag's
values and mission.

We invite you to discuss this proposal further and explore the
possibilities for collaboration. We are confident that together, we
can create a brighter future for Derna and its people.

Thank you for considering our proposal. We look forward to hearing
from you soon.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
