Dear Mr Buzgheiba, 

Thank you for your proposal and your interest in our landscaping
firm. We had a look at the project, and our capacities to do it with
Nicolas Bonnenfant. 

Unfortunately we won’t be able to work on this project, as we are
fully booked for the next few months.

 

Thank you for your interest, 

We wish you a good project, 

Best regards
